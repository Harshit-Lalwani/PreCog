System Prompt: You are an expert math solver. A transition is a pair of characters (a, b) which means replace only the first occurrence of a with b in the string. You can apply multiple transitions one after the other. Given an initial string and set of transitions, your aim is to find the correct set of transitions such that final string is empty. Solve all test problems. Please think deeply and step by step. Think about the consequence of each transition

applying transition 1 ("a"->"b") gives "b"
Response:
{"solutions":[{"problem_id":"050","solution":[1],"explanation":"Given the initial string 'a', we can start with transition 1 which changes 'a' to 'b'. After this step, the string becomes 'b'. Since there are no further applicable transitions that can be applied to 'b' to reduce it to an empty string or any other form effectively using the transitions provided, transition 1 is the only feasible step, although it does not accomplish the aim of achieving an empty string. This reflects the constraints of the given transitions in reaching the problem's goal with this start point."}]}

{"solutions":[{"problem_id":"044","solution":[2,2,2,4],"explanation":"1. Initial string is 'aabb'.\n2. Apply transition 2: Replace 'b' in \"aabb\" with 'badc', resulting in 'aabbadcb'.\n3.

Apply transition 4: Transition with src 'aabadcb', tgt '' can now be applied since the segment 'aabadcb' is found once, removing it and resulting in an empty string."}]}

Your solution resulted in final string "aabadcadcadcb" instead of empty string "". Please provide a correct solution that reduces the string to empty string.

Now, apply transition 4: Replace 'aabadcb' in 'aabadcb' which reduces to '', since the current string 'aabadcb' applies directly to this transition, resulting in an empty string."}]}

Error at step 2: Transition is not applicable as "aa" does not occur in "bbbabb"

Prompt:
Your solution resulted in final string "aabadcadcadcb" instead of empty string "". Please provide a correct solution that reduces the string to empty string.
Response:
{"solutions":[{"problem_id":"044","solution":[3,4],"explanation":"To solve this problem, we start with the initial string 'aabb' and need to reduce it to an empty string by applying the given transitions.\n\n1. The initial string is 'aabb'.\n2. Apply transition 3 (\"b\" -> \"badc\"): Replace the first occurrence of 'b' in 'aabb' with 'badc'. The resulting string is 'aabadcb'.\n3. Apply transition 4 (\"aabadcb\" -> \"\"): Notice that the entire string 'aabadcb' matches the pattern for transition 4. Use this transition to replace 'aabadcb' with an empty string.\n\nBy following these steps, the initial string 'aabb' can be transformed into an empty string using the transitions 3 and 4 in sequence."}]}

System Prompt: You are an expert math solver. A transition is a pair of characters (a, b) which means replace only the first occurrence of a with b in the string. You can apply multiple transitions one after the other. Given an initial string and set of transitions, your aim is to find the correct set of transitions such that final string is empty. Solve all test problems. Please think deeply and step by step. Think about the consequence of each transition

System Prompt: You are an expert math solver. A transition is a pair of characters (a, b) which means replace only the first occurrence of a with b in the string.

System Prompt: You are an expert math solver. A transition is a pair of characters (a, b) which means replace only the first occurrence of a with b in the string. You can apply multiple transitions one after the other. Given an initial string and set of transitions, your aim is to find the correct set of transitions such that final string is empty. Solve all test problems. Please think deeply and step by step. Think about the consequence of each transition

Test:
[{'Puzzle': {'problem_id': '009', 'initial_string': 'ab', 'transitions': [{'src': 'abba', 'tgt': 'dd'}, {'src': 'a', 'tgt': 'c'}, {'src': 'a', 'tgt': 'd'}, {'src': 'db', 'tgt': ''}]}}]
```

{"solutions":[{"problem_id":"009","solution":[2,3,0],"explanation":"To solve this, we need to transform 'ab' to an empty string by making strategic transitions.\n1. Start with 'ab'.\n2. Apply the 2nd transition ('a' -> 'd') which transforms 'ab' to 'db'.\n3. Apply the 4th transition ('db' -> '') which completely removes 'db'.\nTherefore, applying the sequence of transitions [2, 3], the initial string 'ab' is transformed into an empty string, completing the puzzle."}]}

STEP1: "a" occurs in "ab"
applying transition 2 ("a"->"d") gives "db"
STEP2: "db" occurs in "db"
applying transition 3 ("db"->"") gives ""
STEP3: "abba" occurs in ""
applying transition 0 ("abba"->"dd") gives "-1"
Prompt:

STEP2: "db" occurs in "db"
applying transition 3 ("db"->"") gives ""
STEP3: "abba" occurs in ""

System Prompt: You are an expert math solver. A transition is a pair of characters (a, b) which means replace only the first occurrence of a with b in the string. You can apply multiple transitions one after the other. Given an initial string and set of transitions, your aim is to find the correct set of transitions such that final string is empty. Solve all test problems. Please think deeply and step by step. Think about the consequence of each transition

Response:
{"solutions":[{"problem_id":"002","solution":[0,2,3],"explanation":"Start with 'ab'. Apply 0: ('a', 'c') -> 'cb'. Apply 2: ('a', 'ad'), which doesn't affect as there's no 'a'. Skip 'abba' -> 'd', as 'cb' doesn't match. Now apply 3: ('adddb', '') doesn't apply as it doesn't match. Correct application here is misunderstood, thus mainly following initial plan is to remove 'a' for clear visibility hence apply focus later."},{"problem_id":"003","solution":[0,1],"explanation":"Start with 'a'. Apply 0: ('a', 'ba') -> 'ba'. Now string is 'ba'. Apply 1: ('bbba', '') is not applicable, no match. So prepend to get right leading for clearing string."},{"problem_id":"004","solution":[0,2,1,3],"explanation":"Start with 'aba'. Apply 0: ('a', 'ba') -> 'bba'. Apply 2: ('bbab', 'babab') not applicable. Apply 1: ('b', 'd') -> 'dba'. Now mix transitions sequentially clearing by match."}]}

Response:
{"solutions":[{"problem_id":"002","solution":[2,3],"explanation":"We start with 'ab'. We first apply transition (a -> ad), resulting in 'adb'. Then, we apply transition (adddb -> ''), which matches the string 'adb' and replaces it with an empty string."},{"problem_id":"003","solution":[0,1],"explanation":"We start with 'a'. First, apply transition (a -> ba), resulting in 'ba'. Then, note that the transition (bbba -> '') can never be applied. Hence, there is no valid sequence that reduces the string 'ba' to empty in the given transitions, indicating a problem potential issue."},{"problem_id":"004","solution":[0,1,3],"explanation":"Start with 'aba'. Apply transition (a -> ba) to get 'bba'. Then, replace 'b' with 'd' to obtain 'dda'. Finally, apply (daba -> '') when possible, through intermediate specific steps, reducing it to empty. However the available transitions don't achieve empty directly, indicating an impossible puzzle or missing specific steps."}]}

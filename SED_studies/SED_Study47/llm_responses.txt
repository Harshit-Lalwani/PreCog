System Prompt: You are an expert math solver. A transition is a pair of characters (a, b) which means replace only the first occurrence of a with b in the string. You can apply multiple transitions one after the other. Given an initial string and set of transitions, your aim is to find the correct set of transitions such that final string is empty. Solve all test problems. Please think deeply and step by step. Think about the consequence of each transition

[{'Puzzle': {'problem_id': '024', 'initial_string': 'abcd', 'transitions': [{'src': 'a', 'tgt': 'bcabef'}, {'src': 'bcbcbcabefbefbefbcd', 'tgt': ''}]}}]
```
Response:
{"solutions":[{"problem_id":"024","solution":[0,0,1],"explanation":"Initially, we apply the first transition to the 'a' in 'abcd', replacing it with 'bcabef', resulting in 'bcbcabeffcd'. Then, we apply the same transition once more to the first 'a' of the resulting string, leading to 'bcbcbcbefbefbefbcd'. Finally, we use the second transition which dictates that the entire substring 'bcbcbcbefbefbefbcd' should be replaced with an empty string, achieving our goal."}]}
